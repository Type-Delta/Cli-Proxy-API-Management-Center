# Type-Delta CPAMC fork notes

This file records behavior and maintenance work that differs from official CPAMC. Entries describe the current branch, not planned work.

Last updated: 2026-08-31

## Repository relationship

- Fork: https://github.com/Type-Delta/Cli-Proxy-API-Management-Center
- Upstream: https://github.com/router-for-me/Cli-Proxy-API-Management-Center
- Initial fork head: `d249ff008e0bc2803deb23fb3e2c62418a1e8d17`
- Current upstream base: `e0ee7123dfb5aa89a14ff73ac5a5c3bf4db658e0`
- Upstream release at the base: `v1.22.10`

The fork uses append-only merge history. Routine upstream syncs merge official history into `main`; they do not rebase or force-push published commits.

## Current divergence

### DL001: Fork maintenance convention

Status: shipped

Files: `AGENTS.md`, `FORK.md`

The fork records its fork and upstream URLs, repository commands, architecture, glossary, sync rules, stable divergence IDs, validation, and merge history. There is no product behavior divergence at this baseline. Analytics and structured API-key features remain future work until their implementation commits land.

Evidence:

- `AGENTS.md` defines CPA, CPAUK, and CPAMC and documents the `origin` and `upstream` convention.
- This file records the exact baseline, sync comparison, and validation.

Validation on 2026-08-31:

- `bunx bun@1.3.14 install --frozen-lockfile`
- `bunx bun@1.3.14 run verify`
- Result: 424 tests passed, ESLint passed, TypeScript compilation passed, and the Vite single-file production build passed.

## Upstream comparison

Before the initial sync, from `d249ff008e0bc2803deb23fb3e2c62418a1e8d17`:

```bash
git rev-list --left-right --count origin/main...upstream/main
```

Result: `0 2`. The fork had no unique commits and was two upstream commits behind.

After the merge commit and before adding fork documentation:

```bash
git rev-list --left-right --count main...upstream/main
```

Result: `1 0`. The merge-forward record was one commit ahead and no commits behind.

## Append-only merge history

| Date | Fork before sync | Upstream merged | Merge commit | Before count | After count | Validation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2026-08-31 | `d249ff008e0bc2803deb23fb3e2c62418a1e8d17` | `e0ee7123dfb5aa89a14ff73ac5a5c3bf4db658e0` | `c1a2044` | `0 2` | `1 0` | Bun 1.3.14: 424 tests, lint, type-check/build passed |

## Sync procedure

1. Fetch `origin` and `upstream`.
2. Record `git rev-list --left-right --count origin/main...upstream/main`.
3. Review the incoming range and merge the agreed upstream commit with `git merge --no-ff <sha>`.
4. Run the exact Bun version from `package.json`, install with the frozen lockfile, and run `bun run verify`.
5. Update the upstream base, comparison counts, validation evidence, divergence entries, and merge-history table in this file.
6. Push `main` without rewriting published history.
7. Update CPA's `web/management-center` gitlink only after this commit is pushed.
